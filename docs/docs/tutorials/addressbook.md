# AddressBook

This feature allows you to use short names when forming letters by third-party applications via SMTP or `outbox` directory.

This feature is most useful for sending emails from applications that expect usual email addresses.

## Usage

!!! warning "Warning"

    Do not edit `addressbook.txt` file while **pboted** is running as it will be overwritten.

First you need to fill in file `addressbook.txt` in **pboted** data directory.  
Usually it is `/var/lib/pboted/addressbook.txt` or `~/.pboted/addressbook.txt`.

For example:

```
# Each line is in the format: <alias>;<name>;<dest>;
#   alias = for replacement in SMTP (<user>@<domain>)
#   name = pupblic name of identity
#   dest = base64 public bote address
# The fields are separated by a semicolon character.
# Lines starting with a # are ignored.
# Do not edit this file while pboted is running as it will be overwritten.
